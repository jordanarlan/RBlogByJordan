My name is Jordan, and I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in December of 2018. I studied Economics and Data analytics. After graduating I was hired to work at the Better Business Bureau of Oklahoma city. I enjoy learning about statistics and programming and this blog is an outlet for me to use and show what I have learned.
